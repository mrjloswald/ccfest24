## Code

[editor.p5js collection](https://editor.p5js.org/mrjloswald/collections/pE9DfnXUo)

The numbered subfolders represent different code examples. A few are interative on the same dataset.
* 01-06 use the population dataset found here
* 07 uses the Datasaurus dataset. A discussion about how this was generated is found [here](https://www.research.autodesk.com/publications/same-stats-different-graphs/)
* 08 and 09 use the (massive) [2015 Flight Delays](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/usdot/flight-delays/) dataset on kaggle
* 10 data sources for redlining are discussed in the project. 

### The Appendices 

* A quick example of the Gestalt Phi Phenomenon
