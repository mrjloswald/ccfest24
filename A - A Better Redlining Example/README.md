The census tract mappings I got directly from census.gov: [Cartographic Boundary Shape Files](https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/carto-boundary-file.html). There is a section where you could download the shape files for a particular state. From there, I had to convert the files to GeoJSON format. I used an [online converter](https://mygeodata.cloud/converter/tiger-to-geojson), but there are probably other ways to do it. Next, since it is the shape file for the entire state, I needed to filter out non-Philadelphian tracts, which I did by finding a bounding box for the area, and then expanding it by hand to suit my needs. There might be better methods. 

It also should be noted that I assumed that all of the tracts were made up of single polygons, which may be incorrect. If they are made up of multiple polygons, they probably aren't being drawn.
