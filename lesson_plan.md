# Fun with Data Visualization
While the content here wasn't strictly conceived as a single classroom lecture, it was presented as such to an advanced audience with knowledge of both JavaScript and P5. This was an hour at a pretty decent clip and with time for a brief introduction, a few jokes, and questions at the end. 

In an ideal world, there might be mini lessons around: 
* Gestalt and basic design principles
* Various visualization techniques over similar datasets
* Investigating oddities in datasets

## Lesson Plan

1. Overview of the most relevant tools in the P5 toolbox
   - 2D Primitives
   - [`p5.Table` and `p5.Row`](https://editor.p5js.org/mrjloswald/sketches/ZWRloa2AE)
   - The `translate`, `scale`, and `rotate` functions ([scale example](https://editor.p5js.org/mrjloswald/sketches/00H2B2r3H))
   - The `map` function (P5)
   - [Easy interactivity](https://editor.p5js.org/mrjloswald/sketches/Y4Mie8L9f)
2. Design Principles
   - Gestalt
   - Pre-attentive Processing
   - Show the data
     * the right data
     * the right amount of data
   - Reduce clutter
   - Integrate graphics and text
   - Start with Gray
   - Let the Story Drive Your Choices ([11-hour flower](https://editor.p5js.org/mrjloswald/sketches/u2EhyLN67k))
3. Gotchas
   - [Data is weird](https://editor.p5js.org/mrjloswald/sketches/kl4Ricc14)
   - [Beware descriptive statistics](https://editor.p5js.org/mrjloswald/sketches/k-3MglrYK)
   - Cleaning data (defensive programming and/or creating subsets of full data sets) ([preprocessing example](https://editor.p5js.org/mrjloswald/sketches/arjHsLfah))
   - [Large datasets](https://editor.p5js.org/mrjloswald/sketches/WlShbO-Ez) (eliminate what you don't need) 
   - Combining datasets ([Redlining](https://editor.p5js.org/mrjloswald/sketches/-vXWwV9l9)) ([Better Redlining](https://editor.p5js.org/mrjloswald/sketches/R9ONxrJbX))
